# cpufp

This is a cpu tool for testing the floating-points peak performance. Now it supports linux and x86-64 platform. It can automatically recognize the x86 instruction sets and select the proper set to do test.

### Build

```
sh build.sh
```
### Test
```
./cpufp num_cores
```

### Clean
```
sh clean.sh
```

Example on Intel i7 4790K(Haswell, 4 cores, 8 threads, fixed at 4GHz):

```
$ ./cpufp 1
Core used: 1
FP32 perf: 127.8892 GFLOPS.
FP64 perf: 63.9466 GFLOPS.
$ ./cpufp 2
Core used: 2
FP32 perf: 255.7734 GFLOPS.
FP64 perf: 127.8866 GFLOPS.
$ ./cpufp 4
Core used: 4
FP32 perf: 511.5616 GFLOPS.
FP64 perf: 255.7780 GFLOPS.
$ ./cpufp 8
Core used: 8
